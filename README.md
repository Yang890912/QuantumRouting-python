# QuantumRouting-python

This is the Quantum network routing simulator implemented by Python.

- algorithm_v1: GC22
- algorithm_v2: GC23 (SOAR)

## Instructions of Use

We haven't organized the execution instructions. Should you wish to run this simulator, tracing the code might be necessary.

We plan to find time to do this later.
